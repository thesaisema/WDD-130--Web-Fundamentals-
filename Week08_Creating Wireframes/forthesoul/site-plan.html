      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever felt like social media was too much to be on? Have you ever wanted to be on a website where you can take a step back from the world? Well, the purpose of this website is to bring peace and healing energy unto the individual. I am hoping that the user will understand that this website is a safe space to be able to distress and find some peace within their hectic or chaotic life. This is not just a space for troublesome people but it is an open environment for those who want to receive any kind of positive energy in any way possible. Not only is this a website to be able to distress and find some peace, but there is a variety of things that the individual is able to look into–such as things that have to do with spiritual reflection which includes: scripture verses, words of affirmation, and motivational quotes. There is also a section for suggested songs and artists to listen to, that can also provide the user that necessary peace. The music selection will be provided with motivational artists and songs that will only uplift the spirit in a positive way. 
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>There is no specific targeted audience because the perspective is open to all of those that are in need of the peace that the website will be able to provide. Mental and emotional health should be valued more in society and I felt like that was something I was looking forward to doing; finding a space for those that need that space. Regarding a specified audience, the audience ranges from those that may need it or to those that are considering the website as something that might be for them. It would be nice to have therapists or others share the website with people around them or loved ones that are in need of something like this. The audience will find this website more accessible and durable in comparison to just having one thing at a time. In this website, you can read spiritual verses + quotes, take a breather, and even be suggested to some good music for the soul– that is what we are all about. It is important to me that all are welcomed to this website, as there is no limit to who can and who can not access it. The website should be open and welcoming for all that would like to access it.

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <p> Regarding the branding side of things, I will not be sponsoring any specific or any brand in general. I do not feel the need to represent a specific branding, except for a made up one by me. This website is called ‘For the Soul’ and I will be figuring out a specific symbol or logo for the website itself. I am thinking of having a logo of someone meditating because I think that is a beautiful way to convey the peace and soulful experience of ‘For the Soul’. I want to have the peaceful effect flow throughout the page when the users are active on it. Doing this allows those to come to their senses and really look into finding that inner peace for themselves. 
      </p>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
